[XLSForm Online](https://docs.opendatakit.org/xlsform/) is a tool to simplify the creation of forms. Forms designed with Excel can be converted to XForms that can be used with ODK tools.

If the tool below doesn't appear or you need offline support, try [XLSForm Offline](https://github.com/opendatakit/xlsform-offline/releases).
