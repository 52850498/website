Our community maintains a comprehensive set of documentation for all the ODK tools. If you need help, the docs are the best place to start.

**New to ODK?** Start with ODK 1 because it is easier to use and widely deployed. If ODK 1 does not meet your needs, then try the more complex ODK 2.

* Read the [ODK 1 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org) – For users of Collect, Aggregate, XLSForm, Build, Briefcase, etc.

* Read the [ODK 2 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2) – For users of Application Designer, Services, Survey, Tables, etc.

If you don't find the help you need in the docs, the community forum has thousands of ODKers and it is the fastest way to get help on everything ODK-related.
