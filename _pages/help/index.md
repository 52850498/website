# Help

The ODK community produces two suites of software, ODK 1 and ODK 2.

The ODK 1 suite contains our most well-known and widely deployed tools, so we recommend you start there! If you find that the ODK 1 suite does not meet your needs, then try the ODK 2 suite. See [Software](/software) for more.

## Documentation

Our community maintains a comprehensive set of documentation for all the ODK tools. If you need help, the docs are the best place to get help.

* Read the [ODK 1 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org)

* Read the [ODK 2 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2)

## Support

If you don't find the help you need in the documentation, the community forum has thousands of ODKers and it is the fastest way to get support on everything ODK-related.

* Join the [ODK Forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org)
