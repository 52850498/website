Our community maintains a comprehensive set of documentation for all the ODK tools. If you need help, the docs are the best place to start.

* Read the [ODK Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org) – For users of Collect, Aggregate, XLSForm, Build, Briefcase, etc.

* Read the [ODK 2 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2) – For users of Application Designer, Services, Survey, Tables, etc.

If you don't find the help you need in the docs, the community forum has thousands of ODKers and it is the fastest way to get help on everything ODK-related.

* Join the [ODK Forum](https://forum.opendatakit.org)

If you have a private issue that cannot be posted to the public forum, please email project leadership at <team@opendatakit.org>.
