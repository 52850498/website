Our community maintains a comprehensive set of documentation for all the ODK tools. If you need help, this is the best place to start.

* [ODK 1 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk1) – For users of Collect, Aggregate, XLSForm, Build, Briefcase, etc. 

* [ODK 2 Docs](https://docs.opendatakit.org/odk2) – For users of Application Designer, Services, Survey, Tables, etc. 

If you don't find the help you need in the docs, the community forum is a great way to get help from thousands of ODKers.
